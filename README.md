open-golf
=========

Havn't written anything yet. Its all theory right now.

Heres the Idea, use an android phone as the brain and a bunch of cheap rfid chips / stickers / buttons / whatevers attatched to golf clubs somehow, pass the chip near the android phone to signal that you're using that club for a shot, it then tags that shot with the gps reading of where you were standing. It can assume that the previous shot ended where the next one begins. All of this data could be used to generate almost any statistics you want and can be used for automatic score tracking.

The cool thing is I plan on writing this as a free and open source project licensed under the GPL. I'd probably sell it on the android market if thats compatible with the GPL, otherwise I'll just set up donations incase people want to pay me to say thanks. But you can use it for free! or modify it if you don't like some part of it and want to add some feature you want.  I'll also make it easy to access any data created by this app so that you can query it to create useful statistics however you like.

I plan on writting this as an android app and will be testing it on galaxy s3 and s4 (thats what I got). If someone wants to help me make it compatible with iphone as well then that would be great but its not important to me personally.
