- So I already have the gps information. Thats good.

- Get live gps information, check it for accuracy, try to overlay it on a map
  if thats not too time consuming.
  * Implement requestUpdates for gps, do away with this gps listener class or
  * w/e I found online, use the google location API directly. Needless
  * abstraction is needless. imo. I may be wrong

- figure out how to store it in a sqllite db or w/e they use in android phones
- make sure the db file is very easy to find and download / modify
- add an indicator of accuracy of gps reading, yards of error would be best imo
- add a bunch of buttons for different clubs. Click a button start a shot.
- need to be wary of units, looks like android gps defaults to meters,
  therefore it would be best to always work in meters and convert to yards only
  when displaying to users, if they want to see yards.
- We can make assumptions on the timing of when we should turn gps on and off
  when the user hits a club, for example a driver is a long shot and you can
  probably turn off the gps immediately after marking it. Possibly set up this
  as something called "Aggressive battery saving mode"
- Can also ask the player before each round if they're going to be in a cart or
  walking, this information can be used to estimate maximum expected speed
  which can be used to determine if a new location reading is possible or not.
